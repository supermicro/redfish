## Description
This is collection of JSON files containing Redfish APIs to securely remote manage **flagship Supermicro systems** with AST2600 BMC onboard. This guide helps you interact with Supermicro servers **within minutes** via Redfish APIs.

The Redfish APIs are based on DMTF's standard API schema designed to deliver simple and secure management for converged, hybrid IT and the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). Both human and machine readable, Redfish leverages common Internet and web services standards to expose information directly to the modern tool chain. 

Together, Redfish and Supermicro create a dominant alliance for managing today's heterogeneous hyperscale data center environments with an industry standard approach for uniform server management and monitoring at scale. Supermicro Redfish APIs support the DMTF Redfish standards for seamless multi-vendor server management experience.

You can explore the complete DMTF Redfish specification at https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish.

## Usage

## Import the respective JSON file to the API platform.

Once Postman or Talend is prepared, you will need to import the JSON collection to the API platform of your choice. To do this you will need to locate the import button.

#### Postman
For Postman, the import button is on the top left-hand side of the application.

#### Talend
For Talend, the import button is located on the bottom left-hand side. Select "Import API Tester Repository" to import the JSON file.

# GET Requests

For each API platform, you need to set the variables according to your needs. For GET request you need to set values for **sut_ip, username, and password**.

#### Postman 
* When you are trying to set a variable in Postman, you need to click on the variable, and then set the desired value to it.
Click on "sut_ip" and set the variable with the desired IP address.

#### Talend

* When trying to set variable values on Talend, you need to edit the environment. For this, you need to select the pencil symbol on the top right-hand side of the page. Then set up the "sut_ip" variable to the desired IP address. Username and password go in one variable with a ':' between them.

# POST Requests
For each API platform you need to set the variables according to your needs. For a POST request you need to set **sut_ip, username, password, and upload the binary file**.

* To set up **sut_ip, username, and password**, please follow the GET request instructions to set the values for these variables.

#### Postman
* To upload the binary file on Postman, you need to select the body tab and under "form-data" you will have a variable called "UpdateFile" where you can select the binary file from the system.

#### Talend
* For Talend, you need to locate the variable called "UpdateFile" within the "Body" section. If unselected, change the item type from text to file, and then upload the binary file from your computer.
